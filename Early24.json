        "blurb": "\"Spiritual?\" by JINJAJAC challenges the notion of spirituality by questioning the belief itself, and the follow on need to believe that only certain things possess it. The artwork features a mechanical vehicle under a glowing turquoise cloud, juxtaposing the material and the ethereal. Composed of tiny JINJAJAC emblems, the piece subtly critiques the separation of the spiritual from the mundane, suggesting that such distinctions may be fictitious. Through this work, the artist explores whether spirituality is an inherent quality or a subjective perception imposed on reality."

		"caption": "The road does funny things",
		"blurb": "In \"the road does funny things...,\" JINJAJAC has a solitary figure surrounded by a landscape that blurs the lines between reality and abstraction on a surreal road and a textured, indeterminate horizon under a vibrant blue sky. The artwork is composed of countless tiny JINJAJAC emblems, emphasizing the artist's distinctive digital mosaic technique. The choice of mediums reflects on how individual experiences and perceptions shape our understanding of reality. The title hints at the unpredictable nature of life's journey, where the road symbolizes the passage through time and experience. It suggests that the paths we walk can distort our perceptions, leading to unexpected and sometimes humorous realizations about the world and ourselves."
