        "blurb": "\"Spiritual?\" by JINJAJAC challenges the notion of spirituality by questioning the belief itself, and the follow on need to believe that only certain things possess it. The artwork features a mechanical vehicle under a glowing turquoise cloud, juxtaposing the material and the ethereal. Composed of tiny JINJAJAC emblems, the piece subtly critiques the separation of the spiritual from the mundane, suggesting that such distinctions may be fictitious. Through this work, the artist explores whether spirituality is an inherent quality or a subjective perception imposed on reality."
